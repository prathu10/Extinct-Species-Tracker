            {/* Introduction */}
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
                This Project presents an interactive Visualizations that showcases summary statistics related to animal species assessed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), specifically focusing on Threatened and extinct animals. These animals are categorized based on their risk of extinction, which can range from vulnerable species to those that are critically endangered or extinct. The Visualizations aims to raise awareness about the status of these species and the importance of conservation efforts worldwide. The dataset was sourced from two sources mentioned below, providing a comprehensive overview of animal species on the IUCN Red List. The tool includes various visualization components, starting with a map chart, line chart, bar chart, pie chart and a scattered pie chart.

            {/* Goal */}
            <h1 style={styles.heading}>Our Goal</h1>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
                The primary goal of this project is to predict the number of species at risk
                of extinction as of 2024 in each country. By shedding light on these trends,
                we aim to equip decision-makers with actionable insights to protect biodiversity.

            {/* Datasets */}
            <h1 style={styles.heading}>Datasets</h1>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
                We utilized two critical datasets for this analysis:
            </p>
            <ul style={styles.list}>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://www.iucnredlist.org/statistics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={styles.link}>

                    </a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/files/Metadata-15-05-01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={styles.link}>

                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
                These datasets serve as the foundation for estimating trends and identifying countries
                with significant threats to biodiversity.

            {/* Visualizations */}
            <h1 style={styles.heading}>Visualizations</h1>
            <p style={styles.paragraph}>
                Our platform offers a comprehensive visual exploration of species data:
            </p>
            <ul style={styles.list}>
                <li>
                    <strong>Map Chart:</strong> The map visualization offers a global overview of countries with respect to their threatened species. As users hover over any country, the map displays a number that represents the species within that region that are threatened. The map utilizes a heatmap design, where the intensity of color corresponds to the density of at-risk species. Countries with darker shades indicate higher numbers of endangered or extinct species, highlighting the urgent need for conservation efforts in those regions. This visualization serves as a powerful tool to understand the global distribution of species at risk and helps users easily identify areas where attention is needed most in preserving biodiversity.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Line Chart:</strong> The line chart provides a detailed view of the historical extinction rates of species over time. When users click on any country in the map, the chart dynamically updates to show the extinction rate for that specific country, allowing for an in-depth look at how extinction trends have evolved. Users can also select multiple countries at once to compare the extinction rates across different regions. The chart displays data up until 2024, offering a clear understanding of the changes in extinction rates over the years. This visualization is an essential tool for identifying patterns and trends, helping to guide conservation efforts by focusing on regions with the highest rates of extinction.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Bar Chart:</strong> The bar graph visualizes the extinction rates of species over time, helping users understand the trends in species extinction and the critical need for conservation action. When users click on any country on the map, the bar graph updates to predict the number of species that could go extinct by 2024 for that country.
                    <br />
                    Below is the formula used for predicting species extinction:
                    <br />
                    <strong style={styles.code}>
                        (Rate of Country in 2024) Ã— (Number of Threatened Species)
                    </strong>
                    <br />
                    The rate is a value between 0 and 1, derived from historical extinction data. Additionally, users can select multiple countries at once, allowing for easy comparison of predicted extinction rates across regions. This feature provides a powerful tool to identify areas where species are at the highest risk of extinction, guiding future conservation priorities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Pie Charts:</strong> The pie chart visualization provides a detailed breakdown of the different types of animal species at risk in a selected country. When a user clicks on a country, the pie chart appears below the map, illustrating the proportion of species categorized by type, such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. This chart helps users understand the diversity of species that are threatened within that country, offering a clear visual representation of the distribution of these species. It complements the map by allowing for a deeper dive into the specifics of species composition in each region.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <strong>Stacked Chart:</strong> This graph provides a stacked bar chart visualization of the number of threatened species across various biological categories (e.g., Mammals, Birds, Reptiles) for selected countries. The data highlights the biodiversity challenges faced in different regions by presenting a breakdown of threatened species per category.  Each bar represents a country, with segments showing the contribution of each category (e.g., Mammals, Plants) to the total number of threatened species. Further countries are arranged in descending order based on their total number of threatened species, emphasizing the most affected regions. The chart adapts to the selected countries, enabling focused analysis of specific regions of interest.
                </li>
            </ul>
